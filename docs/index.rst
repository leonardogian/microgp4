Overview of MicroGP4
====================

MicroGP (ÂµGP, ``ugp``) is an evolutionary optimizer able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics in finding the optimal solution of generic problems. It is extremely versatile, being able to tackle problem those solutions are fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines.

MicroGP first creates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhances them using the result of their evaluations together with structural information; `several different techniques <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+squillero+OR+tonda+%29+AND+microgp>`__ --- some `inspired by the mechanisms of natural evolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation>`__ --- are used to explore efficiently the search space, and eventually pinpoint the best solution.

Audience
--------

The audience for MicroGP includes ...

Python
------

Python is a powerful programming language that allows simple and flexible representations of different problems.  Moreover, Python has a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages that MicroGP4 uses to provide features such as graph operations and drawing.  In order to make the most out of MicroGP4 you will want to know how to write basic programs in Python.

Free software
-------------

MicroGP4 is `free and open-source software </FOSS>`_, and it is distributed under the permissive `Apache License 2.0 </_Apache2>`_. We welcome contributions.

History
-------

MicroGP was designed around y2k; the first fully working version was `coded in C in 2002 </MicroGP2/MicroGP2>`_, then `re-engineered in C++ in 2006 </MicroGP3>`_. MicroGP would not have been possible without the help and support of `several people <contributors>`__.

. The original version was designed and written by Aric Hagberg, Dan Schult, and Pieter Swart in 2002 and 2003. The first public release was in April 2005. Many people have contributed to the success of NetworkX. Some of the contributors are listed in the credits.

The first prototype was created `around Y2K <HISTORY.md>`__; This fourth version has been redesigned from scratch.
