Overview
========

MicroGP (ÂµGP, ``ugp``) is an evolutionary optimizer able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics in finding the optimal solution of generic problems. It is extremely versatile, being able to tackle problem those solutions are fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines.

MicroGP first creates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhances them using the result of their evaluations together with structural information; `several different techniques <https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+squillero+OR+tonda+%29+AND+microgp>`__ --- some `inspired by the mechanisms of natural evolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation>`__ --- are used to explore efficiently the search space, and eventually pinpoint the best solution.

MicroGP4 is `free and open-source software </FOSS>`_, and it is distributed under the permissive `Apache License 2.0 </_Apache2>`_. We welcome contributions.

History
-------

MicroGP was designed around y2k; the first fully working version was `coded in C in 2002 </MicroGP2/MicroGP2>`_, then `re-engineered in C++ in 2006 </MicroGP3>`_. MicroGP4 has been re-designed in Python to simply its use and exploit the vibrant ecosystem of packages available.

MicroGP would not have been possible without the help and support of `several people <contributors>`__.
