MicroGP (ÂµGP, `ugp`) is yet another [evolutionary optimizer](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/evolution.html) able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics. Since 2001 it has been exploited as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), as a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), and as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas. [Some hundreds papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+MicroGP+OR+%C2%B5GP+OR+ugp3+OR+ugp2+%29+AND+%28+Squillero+OR+Tonda+OR+Sanchez+OR+Schillaci+%29) discussing possible applications can be found in the scientific literature. 

[MicroGP4](https://github.com/squillero/microgp4) is the brand new version, completely redesigned in Python.

* The code is available as a [PyPi package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index) on [https://pypi.org/project/microgp/](https://pypi.org/project/microgp/), and can be installed using [`pip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29).

* The user guide and API reference can be found on [Read the Docs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read_the_Docs) at [https://microgp4.readthedocs.io/](https://microgp4.readthedocs.io/).
