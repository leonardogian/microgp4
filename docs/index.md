MicroGP (ÂµGP, `ugp`) is an [evolutionary tool](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/evolution.html) that has been exploited as a coverage-driven [fuzzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), as a general-purpose [optimizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_optimization), and as a framework for prototyping and testing new ideas. It first creates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhances them using the result of their evaluations together with internal structural information. It is often able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics.

MicroGP is extremely versatile: it is able to tackle problem those solutions are simple fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines; different techniques are used to explore efficiently the search space; candidate solutions can be evaluated using independent, proprietary external tools. Some hundreds documents discussing MicroGP and its applications can be found [in the scientific literature](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%28+MicroGP+OR+%C2%B5GP+OR+ugp3+OR+ugp2+%29+AND+%28+Squillero+OR+Tonda+OR+Sanchez+OR+Schillaci+%29)


* MicroGP4 is available as a [PyPi package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index) on [https://pypi.org/project/microgp/](https://pypi.org/project/microgp/), and can be installed using [`pip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_%28package_manager%29).

The project started around the year [2000](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/history.html#microgp1), with the creation of a collection of scripts for optimizing assembly-language programs. A fully working program was coded in C in [2002](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/history.html#microgp2), and then re-engineered in C++ in [2006](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/history.html#microgp3); the design of a Python version started in [2018](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/history.html#microgp4). MicroGP4 would not have been possible without the help and support of [several people](https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/contributors.html).
