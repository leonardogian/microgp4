What is MicroGP?
""""""""""""""""

MicroGP is an `evolutionary optimizer <https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/evolution.html>`__ able to outperform both human experts and conventional heuristics in finding good solution of hard problems. It first creates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhances them using the result of their evaluations together with structural information. Different techniques are used to explore efficiently the search space.

MicroGP is extremely versatile: it is able to tackle problem those solutions are simple fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines; moreover, candidate solutions can be evaluated using independent, proprietary external tools. `Several papers <https://scholar.google.it/scholar?q=%28+MicroGP+OR+%C2%B5GP+%29+AND+%28+Squillero+OR+Tonda+%29>`__ reporting possible applications can be found in the scientific literature.

The `history <https://squillero.github.io/microgp4/history.html>`__ of MicroGP started around 2000 with the creation of a collection of scripts for optimizing assembly-language programs, a fully working version was coded in C in 2002 and then re-engineered in C++ in 2006. The design of a Python version started in 2018.

Audience
========

The audience for NetworkX includes mathematicians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and social scientists. Good reviews of the science of complex networks are presented in Albert and Barab√°si [BA02], Newman [Newman03], and Dorogovtsev and Mendes [DM03]. See also the classic texts [Bollobas01], [Diestel97] and [West01] for graph theoretic results and terminology. For basic graph algorithms, we recommend the texts of Sedgewick (e.g., [Sedgewick01] and [Sedgewick02]) and the survey of Brandes and Erlebach [BE05].
